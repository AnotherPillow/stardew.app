# Purpose: Gather all information about fish needed to complete the fishing achievements.
#          Logic is mainly ported from the game's source code to decide which fish don't count.
#          see StardewValley/Stats.cs::checkForFishingAchievements() or
#          StardewValley/Utility.cs::getFishCaughtPercent()
# Result is saved to data/fish.json
#
# Content Files used: Fish.json, Objects.json,
# Wiki Pages used: https://stardewvalleywiki.com/<fish_name>
